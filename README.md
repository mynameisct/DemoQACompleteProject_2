As Discussed, we have implemented the logging as a beginner.

This is core backbone in Realtime because it helps us in de-bugging, avoiding any other issue like -

False Positives :- A test actually passes but our script shows test case failed.

False Negatives :- A test actually fails, but our script shows test case passed

Test Script Fails, But didnt know where :- This is main reason for these logging implementation integrated with TestNG Listners.

and many more benefits...
